          <li><b>1903</b> - He founded the Austrian Mathematical Society together with Gustav von Escherich and Emil MÃ¼ller.</li>
          <li><b>1905</b> - On September 5, 1906, while on a summer vacation in Duino, near Trieste, Boltzmann hanged himself. Many beleived his suicide was because of the vicious attacks he received from the Scientific Establishment of the day for advocating his Kinetic Thoery.</li>
